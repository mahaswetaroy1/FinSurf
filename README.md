# FinSurf: Credit Risk & Customer Retention Analytics Platform

A robust end-to-end data analytics and machine learning project simulating real-world churn and credit risk modeling in the fintech domain.

---

## Project Summary

**Objective:**  
Predict customer churn and credit risk, uncover revenue leakage, and build actionable dashboards using ML + BI.

**Stack:**  
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, SHAP, Matplotlib)  
- Power BI  
- PostgreSQL (optional)  
- Excel  

**Project Goals:**
- Clean and preprocess financial lending datasets
- Engineer churn-relevant and credit-relevant KPIs
- Build ML models to predict churn
- Explain predictions using SHAP
- Integrate predictions into Power BI dashboards

## Phase 1: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

- Loaded LendingClub-style dataset with churn flags
- Dropped columns with >50% missing
- Cleaned tenure, income, rate columns
- Engineered:
  - `customer_tenure` (months)
  - `ARPU`, `CLTV`
  - Income bins, product segments (planned)

---

## Phase 2: KPI Development

Computed and validated:

| KPI   | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| PD    | Probability of Default |
| LGD   | Loss Given Default |
| ECL   | Expected Credit Loss |
| ARPU  | Avg. Revenue Per User |
| CLTV  | Customer Lifetime Value |

Tools: Pandas, SQL views, Seaborn

---

## Phase 3: Churn Prediction Modeling

- **Model Used:** XGBoost Classifier  
- **Train/Test Split:** 80/20, stratified on churn_flag  
- **Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC AUC  
- **Probability Outputs:** Yes  
- **Model Outputs Saved to CSV:** `xgb_churn_predictions.csv`

---

## Phase 4: SHAP Explainability

- Used `shap.TreeExplainer` to interpret model decisions
- Plots saved:

<img src="outputs/shap_bar_plot.png" width="400"/>

- Key churn drivers: e.g., `tenure`, `CLTV`, `int_rate` (based on bar plot)

---

## Phase 5: Power BI Integration

- Predictions imported into Power BI  
- Visualizations:
- Churn Probability Distribution (Histogram)
- Total Predicted Customers (Card)
- Churned vs Retained Count (Bar)
- KPI Cards: Avg ARPU, CLTV by Churn Status

> Dataset used in Power BI: `outputs/xgb_churn_predictions.csv`

---

## Next Phases (In Progress)

- Done: Data Cleaning, KPI, XGBoost Modeling, SHAP, Power BI
- Next: 
- Phase 6: K-Means Segmentation
- Phase 7: Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA/Prophet)
- Phase 8: A/B Simulation
- Phase 9: Streamlit Deployment (Optional)
